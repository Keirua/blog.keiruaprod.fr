To my surprise, I've been playing Pokemon Go almost everyday for the last 6 months.

The game itself has no real purpose and no end. You can do stuff, but there is no ultimate goal that you need to reach. Much like a startup, or a side project.
Maybe working on a side project would be more fun if we saw its inception like playing daily a small video game, slowly building stuff and eventually being super strong.

I'm not going to talk about the game itself, but here are some techniques it uses have made me happy to play:

 - it's **varied**. You can fight other players, catch pokemons, do quests, hatch eggs by walking…
 - there is **always something to do**. Even if you only have a few minutes, you can maybe catch a couple pokemons.
 - **you can prepare, schedule**: there are weekly quests that require to checkin everyday. I always prepare one or 2 in advance, and plan them ahead.
 - there is **not one way to do things**. You can do many quests a day, or just one, you can skip fights…
 - there are **rewards**. You get particular stuff if you catch one pokemon everyday for a week, if you do the weekly quests or walk a lot.
 - it's **easy at first, then challenging**. Some of the long quests I've made involved walking a lot, or going places I didn't often go. In the first few levels, you also progress quickly
 - sometimes it's boring, and yet you play anyway in order not to destroy a streak for a major multi-day quest
 - it's **social***. I have friends that I play with and whom I exchange tips. I also occasionnaly chat with random strangers playing in the streets, which is something I would never do otherwise

…all those characteristics can apply to a side project, it's a matter of perspective
