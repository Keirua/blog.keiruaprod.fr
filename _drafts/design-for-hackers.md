# The basics of user experience design

    The user experience design of a product essentially lies between the intentions of the product and the characteristics of your user. The foundations of user experience really shape a product, ultimately providing constraints for visual design decisions.

    If I were to design a hammer, my intentions for that hammer would be that it would be used for hammering nails and maybe removing nails from time to time. I would then make some assumptions about the user of the hammer. Hopefully, my budget would allow for a little research to help me form these assumptions. I’d assume that the user has a working hand, so I would design a handle. I would take into account that a pretty good amount of force is required to drive a nail into wood, so I’d make the head of the hammer pretty heavy and hard. Sometimes it’s hard to accurately hit a nail on the head, so I’d make the head of the hammer big enough to be a little forgiving but small enough that it wouldn’t be too heavy to swing with some degree of control.

    So, now I’d have the basic form of a heavy object on a stick. But there would still be room for improvement. Through testing of a prototype, I might notice that the head of the hammer tends to twist if I don’t hit the nail perfectly, so I’d be careful to balance the weight evenly. Now, not only do I have a head for striking the nail, but I also have a trailing portion of the head for balancing the weight of the striking portion of the head. This is a perfect opportunity to incorporate, right into the trailing part of the hammer head, a mechanism for removing nails.

    I may experiment with different materials, ultimately finding that a steel head offers the desired durability at the right price. For the handle, I might find that wood is sufficiently cheap and lightweight and provides decent shock absorption.

    Through this process of considering my intentions for the product and the needs of the user, I would have the basic design of a hammer. The hammer is such a well-designed device for driving and removing nails that, when you have a hammer in your hand – as the old saying goes – “everything looks like a nail.”

    But even more complex considerations may be driving the design of my hammer. Maybe a competing company has come out with a similar hammer, and I need to find some way to differentiate my hammer and make it better. Through talking with my customers, I may find that some of them complain about feeling discomfort after driving nails with my hammer all day, so I might try different materials, such as fiberglass, looking for optimal shock absorption. I might find that some customers have trouble maintaining their grip on the hammer, so I might try incorporating a rubber grip and molding the handle to better fit the human hand.

    This whole process that I’ve gone through to create this hammer fits within the realm of user experience design. Not only have I designed a solution for my customers, but I’ve optimized that solution according to their needs and improved the competitive health of my business.








Those are my some of my notes from the book "Design for Hackers".

Here are a few guidelines that will help improve your understanding of design:

 - There's no substitute for lots of understanding and practice. Try to think about what makes something beautiful next time you see something you like. Try also to create things, inspired by what you learnt, by what you like, and by principles.

# Typography

 - Learn about the different types of typefaces, paying special attention to who designed them and how technology influenced the design.
 - Use fonts designed for the screen.

# Proportions

 - The next time you see something that you think is beautiful, take a careful look at its proportions. Can you find any patterns in how the various elements are arranged and sized?
 - Some aspect ratio appear more beautiful than others. Try making your decisions based upon the golden ratio, the root 2 rectangle, the 2:3 ratio, or the 3:4 ratio.
 - When choosing font sizes or making decisions about how large to make things such as pictures and icons, try creating a varied scale (https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography).

# Composition Principles

The following elements refer to a series of ideas about what may make a composition attractive. Those are not absolute truth, but it can provide a framework for decision-making.

 - **Composition**: A good composition is what attracts the viewer’s eye and engages it, guiding his eye throughout.
 - **Dominance** creates visual interest in a composition by drawing the viewer's eye to an important element in the composition
 - **Similarity** means that various elements of a composition (shape, color, line characteristics (smooth or jagged), or texture are similar to one another. It makes a composition compelling because, as your eye travels throughout that composition, it is constantly reminded of things that it has seen before within that same composition. 
 - **Foreground/background relationships** create a sense of depth
 - **Texture** is the visual indication that something has characteristics that would be palpable if you were able to touch them. Texture keeps a composition interesting because it provides an opportunity for the principle of contrast and can create a sense of depth in foreground/background relationships.
 - **Direction**: you can guide the viewer’s eye throughout the composition and helps keep the viewer looking at the design piece. Direction can be established pretty explicitly through lines (and sometimes even arrows!), but sometimes more implicitly through shapes, shading, or even invisible alignment within the composition.
 - **Contrast**: Certain parts of a composition stand out more than others because of differences – or contrast – between elements.
