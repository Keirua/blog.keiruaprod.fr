💪 Exercise + eat healthy
🤔 Reflect on thoughts



If you're feeling down lately, here's a quick test to figure out why:

💖 Have you met up with your friends IRL this week?
🏋️‍♀️ Have you exercised today or yesterday?
🎨 Are you working on stuff that's meaningful to you?
🤝 Have you helped someone today with something you're good at?
💳 This month, did you mostly buy:
Do you think you're eating 🥦healthy this week?
😴 Did you sleep 7-8 hours for most of this week?
 Have you meditated this week? (or any other type of relaxed state, e.g. hot bath/shower)
🌲 Have you gone outside into nature this week? (like a park or forest)
🆕 Did you go for any new experiences in the last month? (like traveling to a new city, or quad biking, anything new)
🍺 Did you drink less than 10 drinks of alcohol the last 7 days?
❤️ If you're in a relationship, are you with the right person?
🌳 Does your current situation give you the freedom to do what you really want to do in life?
👩‍🎨 Did you create anything in the last week? Like art, music, a website, anything purely creative?
