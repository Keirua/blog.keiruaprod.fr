In Praise of Idleness

In Praise of Idleness is an essay by Bertrand Russel writen in 1932. It's 5000 words long, and can be read in 30-60mn. The complete text is available in a lot of places online, here for instance: http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html

The central idea of the book is that there is much more to life than simply work, and that's today's society there is no need to work all day long anymore, because we don't need growth and we have tools that can replace humans.

One of the examples he gives is the fact that during the first world war, most men were at war and yet, the economy of the country was held by a fraction of the population − women. And it was ok.

The irony is that the text has been writen more than 80 years ago, but not much has changed. We have more automation, and yet all the news are filled with the "issue" of unemployment. To Russel, that's normal, and full employment is not something you countries should aim for. Instead, we should aim to have enough work to be sustainable − and as we said, we don't need everybody to work all day for that − and use the rest of the time for leisure. The structure of life changes radically when you start to think of a society that works like this.

Do yourself a favor and read the essay, it will change the way you feel regarding work and unemployment.
