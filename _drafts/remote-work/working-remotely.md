I've been working remotely for more than a year now, as part of 2 teams. In the last decade, I've also had a bunch of short-term clients I've never met in real life. I meet with my accountant once a year but I know he does the job he has to during the year. Thanks to the telephone and the internet, it's easy for people in different locations to work together.

Actually, work can definitively be done without real-life meetings, and yet most software companies have not yet embraced remote work. The tools are there for remote work, but habits and organizational changes are necessary for remote work to be more widely spread in the tech culture.

In this first part, I'll talk about some of the tools my team and I use to work remotely.

 - **project management**: trello, jira, asana, notion… Any ticketing tool in order for people to know what other peoples are doing, keep track of the sprints, and to have basic communication. We use Trello with 2 boards. The business board contains the general roadmap and a corresponding todo list of necessary actions, along with meetings summary and some notes. The technical boards contain the corresponding tech sprints. Use whatever works for you.
 - **code management**: github, bitbucket, gitlab… will allow you to manage the technical discussions through issues and pull requests
 - **file sharing and collaborative editing**: any large project will require you to share tons of PDFs, spreadsheet, presentations… we use Google drive and the Google tools to edit important texts and presentations collaboratively.
 - **email**: we (mostly) don't use email for internal communication (because we don't have to), but it is require to exchange with clients and partners
 - **text chat**: Slack seems to be the most widespread, but many alternatives exist. Riot, Discord, Mattermost, Zulip, Rocketchat, Twist. Communication has to be rethought when people are not replying right away to your questions. water-cooler style chats need to exist. It is important to note that anything put in the chat can disappear (short history, hard to retrieve), so if a piece of information is important it has to have its counterpart in google drive, trello or github, depending on the topic.
 - **audio/video conversations**: phone, appear.in, meet.jit.si, Framatalk, zoom.us, GoToMeeting, Skype. They all have flaws ;) Some require a client to be installed, those who use WebRTC may not work with everybody. You can set them up using a calendar tool like calendly or youcanbookme.

We do a short 1h weekly meeting every Monday morning in order to summarize the previous week and to synchronize the priorities of the upcoming week.

And… that's pretty much it! No need for too many things, especially for small teams. Most of those tools have a free plan, so you can get started for very cheap.

## remote-first and remote-friendly

There are 2 kinds of remote companies: remote-first and remote-friendly. **Remote first** companies are companies where everybody is remote. It is not an option, it is the default. Often, companies like this have been remote from day 1. Since it's the only way they use to work, they are usually well organized for remote work (otherwise, they'll soon be bankrupt). **Remote friendly** companies are companies were remote work is an option. Some members are remote, some are not. This can happen when one of the members of the team moved to another city, and the team figured it was ok to work like that, so they started to offer remote positions on top of the existing offices.

## Rethinking communication in a remote-first setting

In an open space setting, many discussions take place in the open. Random day-to-day things, but also important talks take place. Important decisions can be taken, and some people are aware of those because they overheard them. That's an anti-pattern: if you are out the office or in a meeting, you may miss decisions or important talks. Some of those you'll know, some others you won't.

Remote work forces you to be super good with your processes so that everybody is on the same page. You need to document everything that matter. Decisions, processes, onboarding, team habits, etc. have to be documented somewhere for all to see.

Chat are asynchronous. Since you don't know when someone will be available to chat, you have 2 options:
 - you plan ahead a moment for talking (chat or video)
 - you accept the fact that you may not have an answer right away. That's ok. Breathe, you can manage, everything will be alright. You can surely find something else to work on meanwhile.

A lot of good things happen from this. When you don't have all the time someone who asks a question and needs an answer right away, you can have a lot of long periods to get into deep work, and get a lot of things done. When things are documented, questions are not asked multiple times.
