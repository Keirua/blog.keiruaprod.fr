A couple years ago, I worked with a guy named Kevin in a software shop. He was super bright: he went to a great university, had a better job and a higher salary than I did, and could solve problems faster with more ease than I did.

And yet, one day, with his usual disdain, he confessed: "you know, programming is not even my passion. My dream job is in electronics". It hurts: I consider programming to be one of mine, so what is it that this guy does that I don't do that makes him be better with apparently no effort?

Well, he gave me one of his secrets: he does **one tutorial every day**. The topic does not matter. What matters is 1) **the consistency** and 2) **to be active** in your learning.

Most people I know have a passive approch to learning software development, and to learning things in general. They learn things on the job, but for the broader view of the landscape, they only read articles. In my case, I've found that actually doing things, even just for training, actually leads to a much deeper learning and understanding. His advice of being more active resonated with me.

That's actually not that hard. Pick a domain you want to get better at, pick a very small thing that you could learn, and **do it today**. Wanna get better in website design? Find a page that you like, and try to copy its design. If that's too much, only copy one component. And tomorrow, start again with something else.

The **consistency** is what is gonna make you awesome, because it adds up over time. If you work one hour everyday for learning something new, in a month you'll have worked 20 hours. In a year, that's 240hours, almost 6 weeks of regular job.
