# The multiple hats of a solo founder in a tech company

This post is a summary of a few years working in small tech startups.

What do solo founders have to do in order to run their business ? Well, everything, but what does it emcompass exactly ? I've sorted below the tasks between business and technical tasks.

# All of the hats

Here are many the things there are to do in order to run a tech company :
 
## Business tasks:

 - Sales
 - Marketing
     - SEO
     - Content marketing
     - Online ads
     - Social network presence
     - growth hacking (it's a very broad term)
 - Negotiation
 - Customer relationship & feedback management
 - User testing/user interviews
 - Customer support
 - User onboarding
 - Meeting with customers
 - Financial planning
 - Financial management
 - Billing, Accounting

## Tech tasks:

I've been a software developper for the last 10 years so I know this part well by now.

 - Application development:
    - Core functionnalities
    - Bugfixes
    - Visual design and aesthetics
    - (Automated tests)
 - App lifecycle:
    - Updates/deployments
 - Infrastructure:
    - Provisionning
    - Updates
    - Logging
    - Monitoring
    - Security
    - Performance

## Misc tasks:

 - Documentation (User, Technical, Infrastructure, Processes (Standard of operations))
 - Analysing what works/what doesn't 

If you hire, delegate or work with a cofounder, you may also have management/HR things to tackle:

 - Outsourcing
 - Recruitment
 - 1 on 1, performance reviews…

# How to do all of that ?

That's a lot of things to do −some of those have to be done daily−, especially if you are alone. It seem pretty daunting: how to do that, and how to do that efficiently ?

Well, you probably won't do all of that all the time, but at some point, you may have to be able to do anything from this list. This list is inspired by [the work of bdavidxyz](http://bdavidxyz.com/blog/indie-hacker-meaning/), who focused on the technical aspects − but analysis this part in more details.

According to the [Personnal MBA](https://personalmba.com/4-methods-of-completion/), there are four ways to complete a task:

 - Doing it
 - Cancelling it
 - Delegating it to someone eles
 - Putting it off until later

So, well, your job as a founder is to :

 - **Prioritize**. Find **what is relevant** to do in this list, then do it (or have it done by someone more efficient). You should cancel or defer what is not. The last part is less trivial than it sounds. In my case, I need to regularly analyze what I've been doing.
 - **optimize for impact** : what you do often should be optimized so that **it's done in the most impactful way with as little effort as possible**.

## Priorization

I've read many, many articles on IndieHackers, and I noticed this pattern :

 - often, business people have little tech experience, they'll tinker something. Technically it may not be very impressive, but it'll have huge revenues.
 - tech people, who spend years focusing on the technical aspects, and whose revenues are very small (in the $ x00, or low 4 digits). That's nice money, but that's very small compared to the efforts they put in.

That's not the case of everybody, but it's interesting to note that focusing on making an ideal tech solution is not going to bring customers and money.

This pattern can or cannot be a problem depending on your goal:

 - if you want to have fun with a complex side project, focusing on a great tech solution is perfect − money is secondary to you.
 - if you want your business to strive and become your main source of income, maybe you should not invest the best part of your time on the technical details.

## Optimizing for impact

Your time is limited. At first, you won't have money, but as soon as you do, reinvesting it to grow the company with better tools can be useful.

I'm not sure for the business part, but for the technical part, you setup systems and you delegate:

 - use nocode tools (carrd.co) in order to setup a landing page. Integrate with a payment processor.
 - do not run your own machines, but use something like heroku.
 - hire a designer, or buy templates so that you can focus on the actual product, and on the sales (finding leads, and closing deals).
