La méthode Feynman

Le but : 

 - mieux comprendre des choses que l'on ne comprend pas complètement
 - mieux mémoriser ces choses

Le livre de Gleick

    In preparing for his oral qualifying examination, a rite of passage for every graduate student, he chose not to study the outlines of known physics. Instead he went up to MIT, where he could be alone, and opened a fresh notebook. On the title page he wrote: Notebook Of Things I Don’t Know About. For the first but not the last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject. When he was done he had a notebook of which he was especially proud. It was not much use in preparing for the examination, as it turned out. Feynman was asked which color was at the top of a rainbow; he almost got that wrong, reversing in his mind the curve of refraction index against wavelength.

L'anecdote du cahier est amusante car, comme on le voit, elle n'a pas marché immédiatemen pour ses examens. Mais son but, c'était de **séparer ce qu'il savait vraiment**, qu'il avait pleinement compris et assimilé, **de ce dont il avait des notions** mais qu'il n'avait pas encore pleinement compris. Séparer le vrai savoir de ce qu'on prétend savoir.

Il a par la suite développé une méthode pour comprendre les sujets qu'il souhaitait apprendre, ce qui est resté comme "La méthode Feynman".

Feynman left what is now called the Feynman Technique for learning, which has four steps:

    Identify the subject, the thing we want to learn

write down everything we know, and add things to this repository

    Explain it to someone who’d knw nothing about the topic (teach it as if it was to a 5yo child) => It forces you to use plain, simple terms

« When we speack without jargon, it frees us from hiding behind knowledge we don’t have ». We are pushed to go the the heart of a concept. Brevity is important and necessary, because childs don’t have a long attention span. Do not fear using diagrams and analogies. They were one of Feynman’s most important tools.

    identify any gaps in your understanding. Arguably the most important, it’s where the learning happens.

    Organize & simplify into a narrative. Use simple sentences for story telling, analogies…

Here is how he would explain atoms work, in a sentence:
« all things are made from atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another »

Feynman was nicknamed « The Great Explainer » (« the best teacher I never had », bill gates)=> maybe one of the important aspects of learning is to be able to teach things
Another is component is curiosity: he had a notebook « Notebook of things I don’t know about ». In his bio, Genius, he said he tried to find the essential kernels of each subjects.

This methodology:

    tests our understanding
    challenges our assumptions. Often, we you start learning a topic, you don’t know what you don’t know. « I’m smart enough to know that I’m dumb », said Feynman.
    Reinforces what we do know
    teaches us to be better explainers. By reframing stuff we know, and forcing us to teach things simply, we know that we know something once we are able to do that. Even for particularly complex topics.

Also, it makes knowledge accessible. People get interested to stuff when you explain it to them simply. Tech needs more great explainers !
