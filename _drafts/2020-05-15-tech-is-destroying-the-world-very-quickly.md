Tech is destroying the world very quickly.

I wrote this 1 year ago. It's sad that I did not need to edit more than details.

I spent the last 10 years working for tech startups. It's amazing how fast this sector is destroying the world under cover of providing better service. The scary part is that it's accelerating. 

 - doctolib (a booking service for medical appointments) has data on millions of french people regarding their health (is he sick?), and their health habit (does he actually take care of it?). It's valued around 1 billion dollars. No good can come out of that.
 - google reads your email and has a lot of information regarding what you buy. They don't even hide it: https://myaccount.google.com/purchases 
 - you work for free for google every time you fill a recaptcha test
 - youtube uses dark patterns in order to make you watch more videos… so that you watch more ads, not in order to make you more clever
 - companies like bird, lyft… use green washing for profit while they have an army of underpaid people who do shitty hours to collect electric bike and recharge them… sometimes with fuel-powered engines :(
 - there are a shitload of [stupid connected things](https://twitter.com/internetofshit). Do we really need to waste electricity for that?
 - tech startups send huge amount of spam (sorry, "marketing email") and notifications in order to sell their stuff, cluttering peoples' inboxes and the web with their subscription boxes and online chat.
 - tech startups don't know how to properly deal with the information their users share. There are countless terrible stories, like LGBT people being outed by accident. If you have 1h to spare, [Mike Monteiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ucEt-La9w) is for you.
 - AI/Machine learning is in all the marketers mouths yet the result are definitely not there because… the algorithms don't work outside a limited (though sometimes quite large) perimeter. 

That's just a few recent examples regarding what the tech world does to privacy, ecology and labour market. There may be some benefits but the actual price (not money: the societal cost) are very disputable (do we need a privately-owned database of medical bookings, with all the problems that will appear once banks and insurance put their hands on the data?)

I mean, there are so many pressing problems regarding ecology, like "how can we sustain our way of life with so many people with a destructive behavior", and it seems that all the tech world as to answer is to look away and make more money while it's still possible.
