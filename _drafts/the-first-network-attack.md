One of the first network attacks occurred way before the age of computers, in 1834. Let me tell you about the story of some of the first hackers.

France built the first information network in 1790. It was a mechanical telegraph, called the Chappe Network. The principle was simple: a few towers, in cleverly thought locations, were spread throughout the country. Each one was used to communicate a message to the next tower using semaphore. One tower would make semaphore figures, and thanks to a telescope, the next tower was able to read it, interpret it and transmit it to another one, and so on until it reached its destination. Thanks to this method, in a few hours a message could travel the country.

At the same time, the Blanc brothers, Francois and Louis, were trading bonds at the exchange in Bordeaux. Information about markets movements took 3 days to arrive from the capital using horses. Many traders were trying to have an edge by having information arriving faster so that they could invest safely. Some had accomplices in Paris that would send them information through homing pigeon, for instance! The Blancs brothers were the only one to think of the Chappe's network.

The thing is that this network was reserved for government use, but they managed to use it anyway. They bribed Tours' director, Pierre Renaud.

The complete scheme was like this:

 - an accomplice in Paris was watching the trends. He'd then send a fake gift to Tours' directors' wife: some glove for "going up", socks for "going down".
 - Tours' directors would then introduce errors in an official message he was supposed to send. The final letter would contain a piece of information about the trend, but immediately after he'd send a "backspace" character so that it was removed from the communication. It was discreet since it could pass as a transmission mistake. No one ever noticed that.
 - the last character, containing the key information, was seen by an accomplice in Bordeaux, who was then able to use the information.

They did that for 2 years, between 1834 and 1836. It ended by accident: Pierre Renaud revealed its secret to its successors so that he would continue after his death. He refused and put an end to this story after denouncing everybody. It's amusing to note the 2 brothers were only punished for corrupting the operator: no other law was broken since nobody expected that such a use of the network would be possibleâ€¦
