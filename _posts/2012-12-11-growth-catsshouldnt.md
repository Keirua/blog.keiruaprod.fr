The latest virality hit I witnessed happened a few days ago on Twitter. A new account opened on november:

["place where cat shouldn't be"](https://twitter.com/catshouldnt).

It **opened on november 30th**. Less than 2 weeks after its first tweet, **on the 10th of december** it had **375,000 followers**.

That’s with **131 tweets** to this day: about 75% cat content, 25% answers or credits.
That’s a **very high follower per tweet ratio** !

Of course on the internet cas are often a success, but since 131 tweet is not much we can try and reverse engineer what worked and what did not.

Using [socialblade](https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/catshouldnt), we can retrace the growth of the account during its first 10 days:

It’s interesting to note that, with a similar content but only 8 pictures, it is «only» at 3000 followers on instagram: what works on a platform may not work on another, and putting a link in bio is not enough to grow an account on another platform if you dont use it.


Many tweets «sucked» −for this scale−, with only 1k RT or less. Like this one, on the 5th of december, when the account already had 135k followers: https://twitter.com/catshouldnt/status/1335388286781509633

What are the gems, the tweets that made a lot of retweets ? Let’s have a look day by day:

December 2nd:
25k RT: https://twitter.com/catshouldnt/status/1334073308791283712

December 3rd:
32k RT: https://twitter.com/catshouldnt/status/1334633344709971968
89.8k RT: https://twitter.com/catshouldnt/status/1334860512257929216

Dec 4th:

19k RT, concert: https://twitter.com/catshouldnt/status/1334976109260107778

Dec 5th:
89k RT, 579k like: Cat on a burglar, https://twitter.com/catshouldnt/status/1335140142789488641

Dec 6th:
Many posts, all of them with less than 2k retweets.
After that, at this point in time most tweets have at most 1.5kRT, and very often less than 500 RT.

A few conclusions:
 - The burglar picture is the all time hit: it added 150k followers in a day.
 - Given the overall low picture quality, its hard to understand at a glance why a picture has more RTs than another. Success seems unpredictable
 - my guess is that the lack of retweet may be either inertia (it takes time for retweets of retweets of retweets to happen), or boredom (people have RTed enough cat pictures recently)
 - you dont need original content. You can simply scrap content, credit it, and accumulate a follower base
